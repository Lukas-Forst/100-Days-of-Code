### Tiny Python projects

The following are my implementations of the projects in the book [Tiny python projects](https://tinypythonprojects.com/) by [Ken Youens-Clark](https://tinypythonprojects.com/#/author)

The book takes a test first approach in code development which is a new view for creating new projects.
This way of creating a project with looking at tests cases is definetly more production orientated than solutions / projects I created before
