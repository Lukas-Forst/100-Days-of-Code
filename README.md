# 100-Days-of-Code
A commitment for myself by creating a at least one commit to this repository in any form.

At the start the main focus of this challenge is to create solidity code to learn solidity and create my own dApps or develop for openSource projects.

Day 1 - x: Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contract Course of the following [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ&t=18364s) created by [Patrick Collins](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-py). [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) framework is used for faster developing. <br />
Day 12 - x: Started learning D3.js to create Notion Dashboard and work related project.
