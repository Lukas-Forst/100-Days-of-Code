[mariadb]
name = MariaDB
baseurl = https://mirror1.hs-esslingen.de/pub/Mirrors/mariadb/yum/10.8/centos8-aarch64
module_hotfixes=1
gpgkey=https://mirror1.hs-esslingen.de/pub/Mirrors/mariadb/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-MariaDB

gpgkey line tells YUM where the GPG signing key is
Name file accordingly MariaDB.repo
move the file to /etc/yum.repos.d
sudo mv -vi MariaDB.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
Install:
sudo yum install MariaDB-server MariaDB-client
start MariaDB with:
sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start

Output should look like:
[dbart@centos70-x86-64 ~]$ sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
Starting MySQL.. SUCCESS!
Open a Terminal and write:
mysql -u root -p

/usr/share/mysql/ contains helper scripts
and /var/lib/mysql/
As with /usr/share/mysql/, we don't need to worry about the contents of the
MariaDB plugin directory. It's enough to know that it exists and contains important
files. Also, if in the future we install a new MariaDB plugin, this directory is where it
will go.

The /etc/mysql/ directory is where the configuration information for MariaDB is
stored; specifically, it is stored in the following two locations:
/etc/mysql/my.cnf
/etc/mysql/conf.d/

MariaDB looks into different locations for config file:
my.cnf
# Here is a comment
; This is also a comment
port = 3306 # This is a comment about the 'port' option

[mysqld]

# the same as [mysqld]
[mysql]
# configuration options for the mysql command-line client
[client]
# the same as [mysql]
[client-server]
